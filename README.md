# Chemical_solubility
The chemical solubility of any compound in any solvent is dependent on the molecular strucutre of the solute and the solvent.
Closely observing the trends, we concluded that given enough data about the molecular struture of the compunds, a model can easily
developed to predict the solubility .


We used multiple linear regression and created dummy variables for the catagorical predictors. This project was as much an exercise in
chemistry as in machine learning.

Solubility Rules

When a substance is mixed with a solvent, there are several possible results. The determining factor for the result is the solubility of the substance, which is defined as the maximum possible concentration of the solute. The solubility rules help determine which substances are soluble, and to what extent.

Solubility Effects on Reactions
Depending on the solubility of a solute, there are three possible results: 1) if the solution has less solute than the maximum amount that it is able to dissolve (its solubility), it is a dilute solution; 2) if the amount of solute is exactly the same amount as its solubility, it is saturated; 3) if there is more solute than is able to be dissolved, the excess solute separates from the solution. If this separation process includes crystallization, it forms a precipitate. Precipitation lowers the concentration of the solute to the saturation in order to increase the stability of the solution.

Solubility Rules
The following are the solubility rules for common ionic solids. If there two rules appear to contradict each other, the preceding rule takes precedence.

Salts containing Group I elements (Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Rb+) are soluble . There are few exceptions to this rule. Salts containing the ammonium ion (NH4+) are also soluble. 
Salts containing nitrate ion (NO3-) are generally soluble. 
Salts containing Cl -, Br -, or I - are generally soluble. Important exceptions to this rule are halide salts of Ag+, Pb2+, and (Hg2)2+. Thus, AgCl, PbBr2, and Hg2Cl2 are insoluble. 
Most silver salts are insoluble. AgNO3 and Ag(C2H3O2) are common soluble salts of silver; virtually all others are insoluble. 
Most sulfate salts are soluble. Important exceptions to this rule include CaSO4, BaSO4, PbSO4, Ag2SO4 and SrSO4 . 
Most hydroxide salts are only slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group I elements are soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group II elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of transition metals and Al3+ are insoluble. Thus, Fe(OH)3, Al(OH)3, Co(OH)2 are not soluble. 
Most sulfides of transition metals are highly insoluble, including CdS, FeS, ZnS, and Ag2S. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead sulfides are also insoluble. 
Carbonates are frequently insoluble. Group II carbonates (CaCO3, SrCO3, and BaCOâ€‹3) are insoluble, as are FeCO3 and PbCO3. 
Chromates are frequently insoluble. Examples include PbCrO4 and BaCrO4.
Phosphates such as Ca3(PO4)2 and Ag3PO4 are frequently insoluble.
Fluorides such as BaF2, MgF2, and PbF2 are frequently insoluble.
